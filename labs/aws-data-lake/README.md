# AWS Data Lake Labs

Hands-on labs for building a production-style data lake on AWS — from raw CSV ingestion through governance, CDC, and analytics.

---

## Before you start

**Your instructor will provide:**
- AWS Console URL, username, and temporary password
- Region: **us-west-2** (all labs are locked to this region)
- Your username slug (`<USER>`) — everything before the `@` in your login

**Naming rule — read this once, apply it everywhere:**
Every resource you create must be prefixed `quicklabs-<USER>-` (or `quicklabs_<USER>_` with underscores for Glue databases). Your IAM policy only allows actions on resources in your own namespace. A typo here produces `not authorized` errors.

**Local tools you need:**
- `psql` — for CDC and Redshift labs (`brew install libpq` on macOS, `apt install postgresql-client` on Linux)
- AWS CLI — optional but useful for verifying resources

## Labs

| Lab | Topic | Student guide |
|---|---|---|
| Lab 1 | S3 · Glue Crawler · Glue ETL (PySpark) · Athena | [student-lab-1-glue-athena.md](lab-1-data-lake/student-lab-1-glue-athena.md) |
| Lab 2 | Event-driven ingestion — S3 → SQS → Lambda | [student-lambda-lab.md](lab-2-lambda-ingestion/student-lambda-lab.md) |
| Lab 3 | Lake Formation — row/column/tag-based access control | [README.md](lab-3-lake-formation/README.md) |
| Lab 4 | Redshift Serverless · federated query from RDS | [student-lab-4-federated-query.md](lab-4-redshift-serverless/student-lab-4-federated-query.md) |
| Lab 5 | CDC — Postgres → DMS → S3 or Postgres target | [student-cdc-lab.md](lab-5-cdc/student-cdc-lab.md) |
| Lab 6 | OpenSearch — ingestion, search, and dashboards | [opensearch-Student-lab.md](lab-6-opensearch/opensearch-Student-lab.md) |

Labs 1–3 build on each other. Labs 4–6 are standalone and can be done in any order after Lab 1.

## Datasets and scripts

| File | Used in | How to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `Crude_Oil_historical_data.csv` | Labs 1, 4, 5 | Link provided by your instructor |
| `oil_csv_to_parquet.py` | Lab 1 (Glue ETL job) | [`lab-1-data-lake/oil_csv_to_parquet.py`](lab-1-data-lake/oil_csv_to_parquet.py) |

## Getting help

- Each lab guide has a **Troubleshooting reference** table at the end — check there first.
- `not authorized` errors almost always mean a naming typo — verify your `<USER>` slug and the resource name match exactly.
- Ask your instructor if you're stuck for more than a few minutes; don't lose session time.
